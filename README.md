### Why this page?

Advanced students in philosophy will have found out that reading philosophy can be time consuming. To make better use of one's time, and to be able to read more and read more efficiently, advanced reading techniques are a must. On this page we will collect some ideas and strategies for improving your philosophical reading skills. It is a collaborative enterprise, and we encourage philosophers of all stripes to contribute to this page.

### Is philosophy special? 

The guidelines amnd strategies we will present in what follows are aimed to help people reading philosophical texts. You might wonder why we are pitching this so specifically. Why focus just on philosophy? On the one hand, it is true that much of what we will say may be useful for people studying in fields other than philosophy. On the other, however, philosophical texts tend to have distinctive features that demand a very specific approach. 

One example, for example, is the extreme focus on argument. The argument of a philosophical text is not, as in most other forms of writing, a mere means to an end. It is not a way---perhaps the best way---of convincing a reader of a conclusion or theoretical outlook. In philosophy, the argument should be approached in the way the sciences think of the data presented in a study. It is where the action is. This focus on argument is characteristic of philosophy, and it requires you to approach a philosophical text in a specific way: you are primarily interested in finding where the argument is, how it works, and why the author bothered to include sections that are not directly involved in making this argument. 

This is just one example of what is distinctive of philosophical texts. Perhaps you can think of more. 

## Reading tips

### Why the advice to 'take notes' is at best incomplete
Often you hear people advice students to take notes while they are reading. This is easier said than done. What should you note down? How detailed should your notes be? It is easy to ignore that good note-taking is question driven. Only if you know what you are trying to answer can you assess whether the notes you take---notes you take in the service of formulating an answer to your question(s)---are good notes. So instead of focusing on the notes, let's focus on the questions you should ask of any philosophical text.

### Formal questions
The first questions you should ask yourself are superficial. They deal with the paper's _form_. What kind of work is this? How many pages do we have? How many sections? Answering these questions can be done on a 'first flick-through' of the work. Don't ignore this step, because it will give you a first impression of what to expect of the paper when you start actually reading it. 

1. What kind of work is this? 
2. How many pages? 
3. Who wrote it? 
4. What is the title? 
5. What does the title tell about what the paper is about?
5. How many sections? 
6. Do the section headings tell me anything about what the paper is about or where I can find the argument?

### Content questions
When you actually start reading the paper, don't just take a deep breath and read it from beginning to end. You will waste time doing that. 

1. Read for argument (Write it down)
2. Figure out what details are important by seeing if they align (or strongly conflict) with the argument
3. Be able to formulate your own response to the reading/argument, using evidence from the text.
4. Have a sense of what the most important or interesting new thing you learnt was (Helps see accomplishment and helps memory/retention)
